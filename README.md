export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/YourUserName/Library/Android/sdk

export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$PATH

export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$PATH

export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$PATH

export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH

- Install adb

`brew install wget`

`wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-darwin.zip`
